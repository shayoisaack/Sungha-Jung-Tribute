  <h3 class='section-title'>About Sungha</h3>
  <div>
    Sungha Jung is a South Korean guitar prodigy. He took interest in guitar after watching his father play guitar. His father is himself only a guitar hobbyist.
    <br/><br/>
    Sungha actually was already learning piano when he started playing guitar but was not as interested in piano as much as he is with guitar.
    <br/><br/>
    His daily routine is to practice for one hour when school is open and up to three hours when school is closed. He says that, "It usually takes me two to three days to practice and videotape a new piece but sometimes up to a week for more difficult ones."
    <br/><br/>
    His key influence and inspiration is Ulli Bogershausen who he has since met and been mentored by. His first three albums were recorded at Ulli's studio in Germany.
